# Amphitheatreâ€™s official command line tool

`amp` is Amphitheatre on the command line. It brings develop, deploy and other
Amphitheatre concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with
Kubernetes and your code.

## Documentation

Docs are available at https://docs.amphitheatre.app/cli/ - we are still working
on refining it and contributions are welcome!

## Installation

Binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available [from Github](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/cli/releases/latest).

Compiling from this repository also works similarly:

```
git clone https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/cli.git
cd cli
cargo build --release
```

Compilation will probably take a few minutes depending on your machine.
The binary will end up in `./target/release/amp`.
